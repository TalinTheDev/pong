# Pong

My version of Pong written in Zig using Raylib.
First attempt at using Zig or Raylib to make anything at all let alone a real project.
Also first game where I don't just follow a tutorial.
Wish me luck.

Maybe I will make it multiplayer eventually.
I would love that.

## Update [6/14/2025]
I finished a pretty basic but functional version of this with a title screen and everything.

I like Raylib and Zig and even though I have a bunch of ideas of making 
this better and more... *me*, I am bored of it at the moment so am not planning any updates.

I might come back to it though, you never know.

That's all for now though.

## Update [6/19/2025]
First day of summer vacation, reorganized my desk, wanted to see how code looks with new setup, 
ended up organizing this code. Not many changes and zero functional changes. Commit #5ca2374

Still don't plan on any extra stuff though.
